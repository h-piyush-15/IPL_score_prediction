# IPL_score_prediction

- In this project, I have performed feature engineering and EDA to get insights related to IPL dataset from Kaggle.
– Along with that i build a ML model using Linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, XGBoost and conducted hyperparameter tuning for predicting the first inning score in an IPL match.
– For deployment of ML model, Made a web app framework using Flask.
